### Confection

We have a Confection class representing baked desserts. Your job is to create a new subclass of Confection, named Cupcake and Banana Cake. Cupcakes and Banana Cakes need to be baked just like other confections, but cupcakes also need to be frosted afterward. Write a prepare method for your Cupcake and Banana Cake class that prints "Baking at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.", and then prints "Applying frosting" for Cupcake only.
