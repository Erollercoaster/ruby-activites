## Encapsulation

- wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.
  
### Advantages of Encapsulation

- Data Hiding
- Reusability
- Testing code is easy

## Abstraction

- hides complexity by giving you a more abstract picture
- lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does
- 
## Polymorphism

- comes from the Greek words `polys` meaning much or many and `morphe` meaning form or shape
- a method where one is able to execute the same method using different objects
